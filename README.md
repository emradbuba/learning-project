### Code
This is a sample `variable` name which can be described in different ways. 

```java
// But we can also create a code block...
public static void main() {
    // here comes some code...
}
```

Also a sequence of commands can be written using this one...
```agsl
git status
git add .
git commit -m "This is you message"
git push -u origin main
```

### Links
We can also create links to resources:
