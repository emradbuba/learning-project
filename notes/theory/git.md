`git branch -a` will list all branches - local and remote ones the git is now aware of: 
```
* dev
  main
  migrate-theory
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/migrate-theory
```

`git fetch --prune` will update the state and remove "remotes/" branches with are no longer on remote repo: 
```
$ git fetch --prune
From github.com:emradbuba/learning-project
 - [deleted]         (none)     -> origin/create-new-bracch
```
Then, the local branches can be remoted as well (`git branch -D create-new-bracch`)
